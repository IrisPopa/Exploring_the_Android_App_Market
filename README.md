# Project Description

In this project, I  analyzed the Android app market by comparing ~10k apps in Google Play across different categories.
I  also used the user reviews to draw a qualitative comparision between the apps.
The dataset I used was scraped from Google Play Store in September 2018 and was published on Kaggle. Here are the details:

**datasets/apps.csv**
This file contains all the details of the apps on Google Play. There are 9 features that describe a given app.

**datasets/user_reviews.csv**
This file contains a random sample of 100 most helpful first user reviews for each app. 
The text in each review has been pre-processed and passed through a sentiment analyzer.

This was a guided project made on the DataCamp platform. In a guided project, learners are provided with a set of instructions and a specific goal to achieve using a real-world dataset.
