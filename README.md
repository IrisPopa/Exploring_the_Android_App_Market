# Project Description

In this project, I  analyzed the Android app market by comparing ~10k apps in Google Play across different categories.
I  also used the user reviews to draw a qualitative comparision between the apps.
The dataset I used was scraped from Google Play Store in September 2018 and was published on Kaggle. Here are the details:

**datasets/apps.csv**
This file contains all the details of the apps on Google Play. There are 9 features that describe a given app.

**datasets/user_reviews.csv**
This file contains a random sample of 100 most helpful first user reviews for each app. 
The text in each review has been pre-processed and passed through a sentiment analyzer.

# Project Tasks

5. Size and price of an app
6. Relation between app category and app price

8. Popularity of paid apps vs free apps
9. Sentiment Polarity Distribution

This is a guided project I have done on the DataCamp platform. Guided projects provide learners with a structured approach to working with real-world datasets, providing step-by-step instructions and a clear goal to achieve.
